# CustomFanController
Creates a circular fan control dial that offers multiple selections marked by numeric indicators: 0 for off, 1 for low, 2 for medium, and 3 for high.

## Introduction
The app creates a circular UI element that resembles a physical fan control. It uses a custom view that extends View to draw a circular fan control dial with an indicator and text labels for the settings: 0 (off), 1 (low), 2 (medium), and 3 (high). When the user clicks the dial, it moves the dial indicator to the next selection, and changes the dial's color from gray to green for selections 1-3 (indicating that the fan power is on).
